## Introduction {#intro}

SportSee is designed to provide a holistic view of an individual's fitness journey.

This repository contains the complete codebase for the SportSee application, including both the front-end and back-end components. The front-end is built with React, while the back-end is powered by Node.js and Express.js. The application uses a RESTful API to communicate between the front-end and back-end.

The frontend has two operating modes: =="API" and "MOCK"==
: When "API" set top true, the 'dataFetcher' service will use axios to bring the data from the back-end. However, if set to false (offline) mode will import the data without the need of an API or back-end.
