# SportSee

Welcome to the SportSee-fullApp repository! üëã
This repository contains the full application code for SportSee, a comprehensive fitness tracking and analysis platform that uses
[Recharts](#https://recharts.org/en-US/) to visually display the user's data regarding their fitness condition. SportSee allows users to track their physical activities, monitor their fitness progress, and gain valuable insights into their health and performance.

## [Introduction]

SportSee is designed to provide a holistic view of an individual's fitness journey.

This repository contains the complete codebase for the SportSee application, including both the front-end and back-end components. The front-end is built with React, while the back-end is powered by [Node.js](#https://nodejs.org/en) and [Express.js](#https://expressjs.com/). The application uses a RESTful API to communicate between the front-end and back-end.

> The frontend has two operating modes: "API" and "MOCK"
> : When the "API" mode is set to true, the 'dataFetcher' service will use axios to bring the data from the back-end. However, if set to false (offline mode) it will import the data without the >need of an API or back-end.

`services/dataFetcher.js`

#### 3.4 Possible endpoints

This project includes four endpoints that you will be able to use:

- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}` - retrieves information from a user. This first endpoint includes the user id, user information (first name, last name and age), the current day's score (todayScore) and key data (calorie, macronutrient, etc.).
- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}/activity` - retrieves a user's activity day by day with kilograms and calories.
- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}/average-sessions` - retrieves the average sessions of a user per day. The week starts on Monday.
- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}/performance` - retrieves a user's performance (energy, endurance, etc.).

**Warning, currently only two users have been mocked. They have userId 12 and 18 respectively.**

#### 3.5 Examples of queries

- `http://localhost:3000/user/12/performance` - Retrieves the performance of the user with id 12
- `http://localhost:3000/user/18` - Retrieves user 18's main information.
